In a nutshell, the IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, machines, machanical machines, objects, animals, people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to send and receive data over the internet without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions.
The data transmitted by a single device (thing) might not cause any privacy issue on its own. However, when data from multiple devices are gathered, collated and analyzed, it can yield to a major privacy	violation. End users fail to understand the consequences of sharing IoT devices data and the possible security threats that result of sharing these data The purpose of this project is to investigate the impact of using smart devices (things) that collect and communicate data over the internet on the individual privacy.

Some of the questions below might have been asked by some intruders when they have access to smart home dataset that are on the internet. The questions are mainly focused on the privacy of the smart home. 

General Questions
1. Can the data show the gender of the subject/resident?
2. Can a living style tell the personality of the person?
3. How many subjects are at home?
4. How do we know if the subjects are sleeping or they are just lying on the bed?
5. What are the patterns that can be studied to predict what the subject is going to do next?
6. In terms of security of the house, what are the time that subjects not at home?
7. How can anomaly activities be recognized in this dataset? (eg. outlier)

Questions to this dataset (MIT Activity)
8. What are some time which may indicate sleeping for this dataset?

Questions to this dataset (ARAS)
8. How can we tell the activities are performed by resident 1 or resident 2?

Questions to this dataset (Kasteren Activity)
8. How to differentiate preparing breakfast or lunch when kitchen is used?

Questions are answered in different python scripts.
